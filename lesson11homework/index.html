                    <p>Preheat oven to 400°
                        Peel the sweet potato and cut into ½ inch cubes. Put the cubes in a single layer on a parchment line baking sheet. Toss with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast until they are fork tender and beginning to caramelize, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature.
                        While sweet potato is in the oven, cook quinoa. Add quinoa and water to a small saucepan, bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook 15 minutes until water is absorbed. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.
                        In a small bowl, whisk together dressing ingredients.
                        Toss cooled sweet potato cubes, quinoa, chickpeas, seeds, bell pepper, spinach sunflower seeds, and parsley together in a large bowl.
                        Pour the dressing over the salad and gently toss to combine.</p>

                        With cooking spray, lightly spray a piece of foil large enough to loosely wrap quartered beets.
                        Place beets on the oiled side of the foil, and loosely wrap to make a sealed package.
                        Put foil-wrapped beets on a baking sheet in the center of the oven and roast 30-45 minutes until tender.
                        In the last 5 minutes of roasting time, spread walnuts on the baking sheet alongside the roasting beets to toast.
